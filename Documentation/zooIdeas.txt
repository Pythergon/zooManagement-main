Just a file to brain dump no
matter how stupid it is.

Were gonna need some time modules to run the Game
there should be a main loop which will handle player I/o
and then a second loop running animal stuff

Check out java.util.LocalDate

DONE Fulfill Java coding standards - class defs and Objects need to be capatilized 
DONE instances of class should be lowercased 

Spawn single thread for all animals that will hold the hunger updates ect for
all the animals - Increment in 100ms delays for efficency sake

Try moving the runTimeLoops() function to the zooManagement Script

Things for the Game:

Animals get hungry
 |--> Every five minutes or so
Animals escape
 |--> Every twenty minutes or so

New ideas:

Animal happiness

Animals mate 
 |--> If hunger < 2
 |--> If container.spaceLeft != 0
 |--> If gender1 != gender2
 |--> If animals == happy 
 |--> Every half hour
