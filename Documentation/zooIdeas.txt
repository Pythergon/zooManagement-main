Just a file to brain dump no
matter how stupid it is.

Were gonna need some time modules to run the Game
there should be a main loop which will handle player I/o
and then a second loop running animal stuff

Check out java.util.LocalDate

Things for the Game:

Animals get hungry
 |--> Every five minutes or so
Animals escape
 |--> Every twenty minutes or so

New ideas:

Animal happiness

Animals mate 
 |--> If hunger < 2
 |--> If container.spaceLeft != 0
 |--> If gender1 != gender2
 |--> If animals == happy 
 |--> Every half hour
